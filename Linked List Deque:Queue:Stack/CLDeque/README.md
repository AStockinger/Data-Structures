Function definition and implementation files for a circular linked list. 

circularListMain.c calls relevant functions for testing purposes.

The linked list is built with a sentinel link to determine where it starts and ends. Initializing the list will allocate the sentinel and set the list size to 0, which will be adjusted as links are added or removed. Links can be read from, added to or removed from the 'front' or 'back' of the list. A specific link can be removed if passed into the removeLink function. The entire list may be printed. The list can also be reversed.
