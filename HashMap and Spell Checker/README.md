The make file will compile 3 executables--one is a test for the hashmap functions, the next is a program that will count all the words in a txt file, convert them to all lower-case, and count the number of occurrences of that word. The last program uses a txt dictionary file to compare user input to the contents of that file, and if not found, then Levenstein distance will be used to return a list of possible words the user could have meant (a spell checker).
